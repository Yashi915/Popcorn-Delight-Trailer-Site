My Project Name is Popcorn Delight. It is a Single Page Web Application which consist various features for trailers. It provides both Sign In and Sign Up form for getting trailers of New Top-Rated movies available in various languages like Hollywood, Tollywood, Bollywood, etc. Here are some FAQs also which help you to understand my website. I also use an additional feature here i.e. Weather Application which tells about current date, moderate temperature, weather, maximum-minimum temperature, etc. It helps to inform a person about current weather conditions so that he can plan for cinemas according to weather after watching top-rated trailers on this website. but still i use only HTML, CSS & Java Script to make this website as a frontend project but there are various possibilities to procced it in more attractive and enjoyable mood, so you can easily contribute to transform it into a fully working website by only just clone this code into VS-Code and click on Live Server to display its output.
